Changes for Algorithm::Merge
----------------------------

0.08 -   21 Mar 2007

  Fixed a problem where certain differences would cause corruption 
  later in the traverse_sequences3 output.  Reported by Mark Glines.

0.07 -   21 Mar 2007

  Fixed an entry in the internal state mapping that was causing a one-off
  error in certain cases.  Reported by Mark Glines.

0.06 -   20 Mar 2007

  Fixed outstanding tickets on rt.cpan.org (#11184, #14483).

  Fixed a bug found by Mark Glines.  This resulted in an additional
  entry in the callback map.

0.05  -   6 Nov 2003

  Added some more entries to the callback map.

  Thanks to Chia-liang Kao for bringing these to our attention.

0.04  -  29 Oct 2003

  Added some more entries to the callback map.

  Thanks to Chia-liang Kao for bringing these to our attention.

0.03  -  22 Apr 2003

  Fixed some bugs in the traverse_sequences3, diff3, and merge routines.

    merge: properly manage conflicts that remain after processing the 
           diff3 results

    traverse_sequences3: defined some more states in the Callback Map.

    diff3: handle some sequence differences better

  Thanks to Martin Hosken for bringing these to our attention.

0.02  -  19 Feb 2003

  Change from Algorithm::Diff::diff to Algorithm::Diff::traverse_sequences.  
  Saves a little time and some memory, especially for large sequences.

  Added CHANGES file to track changes.

0.01  -  17 Feb 2003

  Initial beta release.
